Build a course from a description of objectives and be able to import into an LMS with resources already there! 

The problem: creating new courses for LMS consumption quickly 
Solution: Build course outlines with open educational resources available to any LMS and based on standards/course objectives. 

Flow: 
- User Imports standards within a course/curriculum map document via a CASE (http://wwww.imsglobal.or/case)  file or CSV 
	- Ideally the course objectives are mapped to standards... the app could help the user tag those objectives to state standards on the CASE Network (http://casenetwork.imsglobal.org) 
- Based on the state standards, search for and display different types of OER resources - most student focused using Creative Commons search etc. 
- Then add open assessments (QTIâ€¦ TAO has a ton) and select them or upload your own (create own with h5p etc eventually too
- User can modify the order of the objectives, pick and choose the above resourcs to be part of certain sections etc then ready to export
- Export as common cartridge file for use by any LMS such as Canvas, Moodle etc
- Once in the LMS, they can add other information like dates, syllabi etc. This app is only intended to help build the content as a rough draft/showcase using open intereoperability standards  for finishing in their native LMS
