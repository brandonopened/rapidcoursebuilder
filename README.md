Build a course from a description of objectives and be able to import into an LMS with resources already there! 

The problem: creating new courses for LMS consumption quickly 
Solution: make building the course with resources an independent service available to any LMS and based on standards/course objectives

User Import standards within a course/curriculum map document via a case file or CSV 
	- searches a specific state standards and matches the text to a Standard (could even use SkillMapper API) 
	- if standards have exemplars, automatically import them as content? 
	- Rubrics too in the CASE Package could be used
- Use lti resource search to search for different types of OER resources - most student focused but also activities using Creative Commons search
- Also free assessments (QTIâ€¦ TAO has a ton) and select them or upload your own (create own with h5p etc eventually too
- Export as common cartridge to any LMS
