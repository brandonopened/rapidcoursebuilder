# rapidcoursebuilder
Build a course from a description of objectives and be able to import into an LMS with resources already there! 

The problem: creating new courses for LMS consumption quickly 
Solution: make building the course with resources an independent service available to any LMS and based on standards/course objectives

User Import standards within a course/curriculum map document via a case file or CSV 
	- if standards have exemplars, automatically import them
	- if ‘skills’ or other associations such as ‘part of’ associations to the holistic framework as included also show those! 
	- Rubrics too in the CASE Package… 
- Ability to Separate into modules  (could happen later too)
- Use lti resource search to search for different types of OER resources - most student focused but also activities using Creative Commons search
- Also free assessments (QTI… TAO has a ton) and select them or upload your own (create own with h5p etc eventually too)
- Align course progressions
…

Export as common cartridge to any LMS
